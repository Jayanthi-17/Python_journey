The black brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. A stitch in time saves nine. Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.
 An apple a day keeps the doctor away. It's raining cats and dogs outside, I can hear the thunder rolling in the distance. She sells
  seashells by the seashore, and her name is python. 
In the midst of chaos, there  opportunity. Knowledge is power, and with great power comes great responsibility. Life is 10% what 
happens to us and 90% how we react to it. The only way to do great work is to love what you do. Time flies over us, but leaves its 
shadow behind.
No one can make you feel inferior without your jayannnnnn. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. You must be the 
change you wish to see in the world. The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today. Life isn’t about waiting for 
the storm to pass, it’s about learning how to dance in the rain.
